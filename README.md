# SVG Editor Intro

The main purpose of this project is to create a SVG Editor using only functional programming techniques.

# Starting the project

Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

Start the project

```
npm run start
```

This will start the project at this address: http://localhost:1234/

Run the tests

```
npm run test
```

You can also run the tests in watch mode using the test-dev command.

The project is intended to be destributed as a library. For development I've added an index.html to serve as a playground, so that the features can be tested quickly during development.
